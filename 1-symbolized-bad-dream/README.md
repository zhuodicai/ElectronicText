# Symbolized Bad Dream

in the form of loop

Dreams are full of random symbols, it is in the same nature as a randomized poetry generator. So I am trying to simulate the mechanism of how the dream is generated.  I extract some symbols from my dream diary. Then the symbol content is converted into symbol text, which is randomly combined in Python like the dream does. For this generator, the dream itself is a loop, one of the forms of my nightmares. In the further experiment, I’ll explore more forms. Other thoughts are below.

- Dream is not only about exact symbols, but also matters by the form of plot. The symbol can be deemed as words in Python’s list. The form is how we construct the words.
- The carefully the words are classified, the more flexible they can be used. (grammar + semantic)

The rhetoric I choose is called **Chiasmus** with a structure basically symmetrical like a ring. Chiastic narrative techniques are commonly adopted in classical prose such as *Histories of Herodotus.* But there’s another similar rhetoric called **Antimetabole** with an A-B-B-A structure that we may be confused with.
