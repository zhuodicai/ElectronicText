# Emoticon for the Speechless

I usually do not know what to reply to in such kind of situation. If I say sorry, she may think Iâ€™m too serious. But if I say LOL, she may think there is something wrong with me. I don't want to seem too nervous or make fun of people, and I don't want to be speechless to make her feel embarrassed. So I need to **use something to cover up the panic of not knowing how to respond.**

People may have the same problem especially when facing their crush.
